# Bird_Counting_Weight_Estimation_Task-2

This repository contains a prototype system developed as part of the Machine Learning / AI Engineer Internship technical assessment for Kuppismart Solutions (Livestockify).

The system processes a fixed-camera poultry CCTV video to:

Detect and count birds over time

Assign stable tracking IDs

Estimate bird weight using a visual relative weight index

Provide results via a FastAPI-compatible pipeline
